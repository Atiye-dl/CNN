# CNN
Training a CNN and test it on different datasets

This dataset consists of 10 classes from 10 different animal species. 70% of the dataset is for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing.

The first phase is Model Designing on a dataset with 1,400,000 parameters.

The second phase is Parameter Limitation, which is the same as the first phase, only with a maximum of 400,000 parameters.

The third phase is Overfitting Prevent. In this phase, the Data Augmentation method and several other methods are used to prevent overfitting of the data and increase the accuracy of the model to the maximum possible value.

In all phases, there are Preprocces, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Visualizing the results. In all phases, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score criteria have been examined for the test data. Also, learning graphs, confusion matrix, and ROC_Curve have been drawn for all new models and training in all phases.
